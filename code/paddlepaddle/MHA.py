    Fully-connected linear transformation layer. For each input :math:`X` ,
    the equation is:
    .. math::
        Out = XW + b
    where :math:`W` is the weight and :math:`b` is the bias.
    Linear layer takes only one multi-dimensional tensor as input with the
    shape :math:`[batch\_size, *, in\_features]` , where :math:`*` means any
    number of additional dimensions. It multiplies input tensor with the weight
    (a 2-D tensor of shape :math:`[in\_features, out\_features]` ) and produces
    an output tensor of shape :math:`[batch\_size, *, out\_features]` .
    If :math:`bias\_attr` is not False, the bias (a 1-D tensor of
    shape :math:`[out\_features]` ) will be created and added to the output.
    Parameters:
        in_features (int): The number of input units.
        out_features (int): The number of output units.
        weight_attr (ParamAttr, optional): The attribute for the learnable

            initialized to zero. For detailed information, please refer to
            paddle.ParamAttr.
        bias_attr (ParamAttr|bool, optional): The attribute for the learnable bias
            of this layer. If it is set to False, no bias will be added to the output.
            If it is set to None or one kind of ParamAttr, a bias parameter will
            be created according to ParamAttr. For detailed information, please refer
            to paddle.ParamAttr. The default value is None and the bias will be
            initialized to zero.
        name (str, optional): Normally there is no need for user to set this parameter.
            For detailed information, please refer to :ref:`api_guide_Name` .

                `value`. Default None.
            attn_mask (Tensor, optional): A tensor used in multi-head attention
                to prevents attention to some unwanted positions, usually the
                paddings or the subsequent positions. It is a tensor with shape
                broadcasted to `[batch_size, n_head, sequence_length, sequence_length]`.
                When the data type is bool, the unwanted positions have `False` 
                values and the others have `True` values. When the data type is 
                int, the unwanted positions have 0 values and the others have 1 
                values. When the data type is float, the unwanted positions have 
                `-INF` values and the others have 0 values. It can be None when 
                nothing wanted or needed to be prevented attention to. Default None.
            cache (MHA.Cache|MHA.StaticCache, optional):
                It is a namedtuple with `k` and `v` as fields, and stores tensors
                shaped `[batch_size, num_heads, length, embed_dim]` which are results
                of linear projection, reshape and transpose calculations in
                MHA. If it is an instance of `Cache`, `k` and `v`
                fields reserve intermediate results of previous positions, which
                mostly used for decoder self attention. If it is an instance of
                `StaticCache`, `key` and `value` args would be ignored, `k` and
                `v` fields would be used as calculated results on `key` and
                `value`, which mostly used for decoder-encoder cross attention.
                It is only used for inference and should be None for training.
                Default None.
        Returns:
            Tensor|tuple: It is a tensor that has the same shape and data type \
                as `query`, representing attention output. Or a tuple if \
                `need_weights` is True or `cache` is not None. If `need_weights` \
                is True, except for attention output, the tuple also includes \
                the attention weights tensor shaped `[batch_size, num_heads, query_length, key_length]`. \
                If `cache` is not None, the tuple then includes the new cache \
                having the same type as `cache`, and if it is `StaticCache`, it \
                is same as the input `cache`, if it is `Cache`, the new cache \
                reserves tensors concatanating raw tensors with intermediate \
                results of current query.
